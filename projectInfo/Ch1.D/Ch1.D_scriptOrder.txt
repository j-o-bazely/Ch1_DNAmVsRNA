This is a guide to the workflow for this repository. Every point will reference the chronological script in the analysis, what that script does and why we do it.

More in-depth documentation can be found within the scripts, with each script including detailed commenting for each code block


Ch1.D.A_objectPreparation
	- Takes in methylation call files generated by Bismark for each sample and converts them into methylKit objects suitable for downstream analysis
		- Global methylation objects (MethylBase)
		- Differential methylation objects (MethDiff)
			- (Note: PQLseq will also be used later to generate differential 	             methylation statistics)
	- Takes sample metadata and makes changes to make it suitable for analysis
